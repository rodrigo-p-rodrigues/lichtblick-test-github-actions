# Used by .github/workflows/release.yml to detect a prior successful run of the
# same PR merge (e.g. a re-run after a later step failed), so retries don't
# create a duplicate "chore: release" commit. Searches the full ancestry path
# (not just origin/main's tip), since other commits may have landed on main
# after the release commit was pushed.
#
# Requires a full (unshallow) checkout: `fetch-depth: 0` in actions/checkout.
# Requires $MERGE_COMMIT_SHA (the PR's merge_commit_sha, not github.sha/HEAD).
# Writes already_released, version, and release_commit_sha to $GITHUB_ENV.
